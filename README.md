# Forest_fire_detection
𝐀𝐛𝐨𝐮𝐭 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚:
This dataset includes 244 instances that regroup data from 2 regions of Algeria, namely the Bejajia and the Sidi Bel-abbes region.
122 instances for each region. The Period is from June 2012 to September 2012.

Forest Fire is a Natural occurring event that requires High temperature, Low Humidity, and High Wind. In my EDA I found that the Sidi Bel-abbes region fulfills all the requirements and shows more cases of Forest Fire compared to the Beja Jia region
